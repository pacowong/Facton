FactumPower
===========
Introduction
    People have their individual thoughts. Living in different areas, receiving news from different sources, studying in different schools and other factors have large implications on one's judgement. People may have total different comments on the same issue. Although it is encouraged to judge everything from multiple perspectives, many people rarely act rationally in debate. However, even we want to think rationally, the related information can be huge and difficult to find. How can computers help us to make better judgement?
    Natural language processing techniques have generated revenues after applying them to perform text mining and movie recommendation tasks. To a certain extent, computers can understand the arguments and discover the counter-arguments. Apart from doing inference in natural language, the system should point out the mistakes and summarize the arguments to as to help the audience to understand the issues and correct their biases. It is feasible to develop a system to make less biased judgement by leveraging the "power of facts".

Implications
    It has the following implications
    1. Promote a rational community
    2. Encourage people to discovery the (temporary) truth
    3. Encourage people to have their own deep thoughts while still being objective
    4. Potentially reduce conflicts among different parties (to increase efficiency and pay attention to human-nature relationship)

Methodology    
    This project aims at reaching this goal in three steps:
    1. Understand the contents of the arguments
    2. Find the counter-arguments
    3. Summarize the arguments

Problem Definition
This is for the offline version of FactumPower.
Input: 
    A set of corpus for the same topic with the authors given.
    
Output:
   The arguments in the corpus for each author, with the support for the arguments
   The counter-arguments for each argument
   The validity of the support
   A well-structured report for the set of corpus

The online version of FactumPower will allow users to provide feedback to the inference and argument matching made by the system which will also learn from mistakes.
